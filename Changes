        *** WARNING: backward incompatible change: "READLINE" had an
          undocumented hard coded timeout of 250ms which made the
          method unreliable. That timeout has been removed. If
          desired, the old behaviour can be attained setting
          non-blocking mode or with a global timeout.

        - Don't warn when undef is passed to method "timeout".
        - Add more tests.
        - Several documentation improvements.

          callback as policy.
        - Rename "remote_port" to "port", "remote_hostname" to
          "hostname" and "check_remote_hostkey" to "check_hostkey".

0.59_01  2016-04-11
        *** WARNING: this release includes lots of changes, some
            visible, most internal. Regressions are expected. Also,
            it introduces some minor backward incompatible changes -
            but in those cases, the old behavior was broken or insane
            anyway.

        - libssh2 version 1.7.0 is now recommended. The module would
          still compile against older versions, but not all its
          features will be available.
        - Makefile.PL has been refactored and improved. Now it is
          better able to find the library libssh2 and compile code
          using it.
        - Lots of XS code refactoring has been performed in order to
          simplify the module internals. Specifically, now typemaps
          are used extensively to convert between C and Perl
          types. Also, some complex non-performance-critical functions
          have been moved to the Perl side or broken in a high level
          Perl wrapper and a low level simpler C wrapper.
        - KnownHost methods now return undef on error instead of
          die'ing. Note that this submodule is still marked as
          experimental.
        - Die when data containing wide characters is passed
          (i.e. outside the latin1 range). In previous versions,
          methods on this module would happily accept strings
          internally encoded as latin1 or utf8 and pass then along
          untouched, resulting in unreliable behavior.
        - In 32bit perls, return offsets and file sizes as NVs when
          required to avoid overflow.
        - Method "new" now also accepts the options "compress" and
          "sigpipe".
        - Passing options to "connect" is now deprecated.
        - Passing a file descriptor number to "connect" is not
          supported anymore (it was already broken).
        - Method "connect" consistently returns undef on error. The
          error code can be retrieved calling the "error" method
          (requires libssh2 1.7.0). In previous versions, some errors
          made the method die.
        - Timeouts are handled correctly inside "connect".
        - Report EAGAIN in the same way as any other error. This
          introduces a minor backward incompatibility, but the old
          behavior was utterly insane and undocumented, and so
          probably, nobody was using it right anyway!
        - Use libssh2_session_set_last_error function for storage of
          the Perl level errors (required libssh2 1.7.0). This may
          introduce some minor backward incompatibilities, but the old
          code was broken and unreliable anyway.

0.19  2009-04-11 01:03:39
        - Updated for perl 5.10 and 5.6 compatibility.

0.18  2007-11-10  dbr  (svn revision 56)
        - Note version change: synced to libssh2.  Should be compatible with
           libssh2 0.16+, including future versions provided API remains stable.
        - Documented Net::SSH2::version class method.
        - Removed references to LIBSSH2_APINO (removed in libssh2 0.16);
           fixes rt.cpan.org #28722.
        - Fixed memory leak in poll (rt.cpan.org #27368, based on patch
           from David Sullivan).
        - Fixed 0-valued POSIX flag translation bug (based on patch from Joseph
           Galbraith).
        - Check lib64 as well as lib for libraries (patch from Leo Eraly).
        - Add blocking method to Net::SSH2 object.

0.10  2007-02-24  dbr  (svn revision 52)
        - Net::SSH2::SFTP::realpath fix (Hugues Lafarge).
        - Make compatible with perl 5.6 (rt.cpan.org #22821, SISYPHUS); required
           minimal changes to typemap and use <version> lines (untested).
        - libssh2 0.13 seems to work, libssh2 0.14 still fails some tests.
        - Add missing Net::SSH2::PublicKey object.
        - Use (arbitrary) 8K buffer in scp_get and scp_put methods, rather
           than trying to transfer the whole file at once (rt.cpan.org #20679).
        - Remove 'use Term::ReadKey'; it's already 'require'd in the keyboard
           authentication callback (rt.cpan.org #22786).
        - Provide libssh2 with Perl's allocator callbacks and use Perl_malloc/
           Perl_mfree instead of bare malloc/free (rt.cpan.org #23930).

0.09  2006-09-25  dbr  (svn revision 50)
        - scp_get fixes: mode mask, truncate on create (Stephen Clouse).
        - Fix O_CREATE to O_CREAT in perldoc.
        - Fix typo: wait_close -> wait_closed (rt.cpan.org #20117).
        - Add example/ directory and read.pl example to manifest so that it
          gets included in the distribution (Danny Thomas).
        - Add Net::SSH2::debug class method to enable debugging output at
          runtime (used to require recompile to enable).
        - Have poll of empty array return 0 early to fix architectures that
          return 0 for malloc(0) (L. Adrian Griffis).
        - WARNING: latest libssh2 builds (0.13, 0.14) don't pass module
          tests any more; if you have problems try 0.12 or earlier.

0.08  2006-05-06  dbr  (svn revision 46)
        - Fix refcount bug (objects not destroyed) (Stephen Clouse).

        - Update Net::SSH2 SYNOPSIS (thanks to Roy Smith).
        - NOTE: CPAN alias AWA (Vandana Awasthi) released an unauthorized
          "0.07" version of Net::SSH2; you can recognize it because it says
          0.06 in the changelog.  I have not been able to contact AWA.

0.06  2006-01-14  dbr  (svn revision 42)
        - Win32 modifications (thanks to Eric Lam for research and patches).
        - Use MAXPATHLEN instead of PATH_MAX; add some casts (thanks to
          bug report from Freddy Soderlund).
        - Update exec documentation to clarify that it runs a single command
          and closes the channel (thanks to Mike Schmidt).
        - Use '' for tied PRINT output separator if undefined (stop warnings).

        - More C89 fixes (-ansi -pedantic); thanks to Chuck Carson for testing.
